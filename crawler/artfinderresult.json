The Moskowians killed, destroyed them and their culture, their languages forming a nation of the great russians only, how they call themselves.  They captured the lands of Finland, Poland, Bolgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the peoples of Caucasus and Crimea and others. We were the great russians, nothing was impossible for us including killings and violence, the russian tsars and bolshevics thought that way. In 21 century the idea of empire resurrection was forwarded putin, the president of russia who is waging war against Ukraine. He considers the Ukrainian people must obey him. But the fact from history - no one could make Ukrainians his slaves! The Ukrainian people are fighting for liberty not only for the land of Ukraine but for liberty of all Europe. Ukraine will be free from the Soviets, Communism and putin's fascism. When the Druids finish their sacred dancing, the russian empire will die forever. No war against Ukraine and the rest of the world.", "tags": "A Decade of Art on Artfinder A Decade of Art on Artfinder"},

It is 40x40 inches. This painting was inspired by a walk I took in July when the flowers were purple and the grasses were golden. I was near the Medway river and as I walked through the field I spotted a tiny roe deer who stood and watched me without any fear (unlike the fallow deer who run away quite fast). His face was mask-like and he looked like a pagan spirit reveling in the beautiful abundance of a midsummer meadow. The countryside in Sussex is magical to me, at any time, but the appearance of this imperious little deer made it more so. The combination of colours is subtle and English people everywhere will recognize the muted tones of a typical, not very sunny, summer‚Äôs day. Painted on deep edge canvas, white edges, ready to hang, no frame needed. It comes with a certificate of authenticity and gifts form the artist.

The photos show the painting in different light conditions. Gold accents throughout the painting , hard to capture on photo, but you could see it in additional detail photos. The predominant color is fluorescent yellow/green.  I try my best to represent the true colors of the paintings in the photos, but sometimes you can see a slight difference in tone. I use professional grade materials and canvases, and the painting is finished with a glaze of UV varnish to protect against sunlight and dust damage. Signed on the bottom. Painting size is 37\"x35\".

The Victorian jug stood out from this background filled with the dried sweet corn and flowers. I particularly liked the muted colours which some how reflected the Victorian era. I liked the composition and the close up of the dresser shelves. I sketched it out and enjoyed finishing it off in oils on a stretched canvas. The painting has a textured finish which reflects the antique look.", "tags": "Best of January Best of January"},

The greenish sky, tinged with shades of yellow and ochre, signifies the underworld, a place where the laws of the Earth no longer apply. The surreal colors of the sky evoke a sense of wonder and transcendence, inviting viewers to leave the ordinary behind and embrace the extraordinary. The meadow with soft purple forests embodies the idea of transformation and growth. The purple forest symbolizes a mystical and magical realm, a place where the ordinary becomes extraordinary. The river in the foreground, reflecting a fantastic sky, symbolizes the passage of time and the ever-changing nature of existence. This oil painting invites viewers to take a journey beyond the ordinary, to explore a landscape where the boundaries between reality and imagination are blurred. It is a testament to the power of art to transport us to unknown places, encouraging us to contemplate the infinite possibilities that lie beyond our awareness.", "tags": ""},

I love how quiet and still the lake is in the early morning before all the boat traffic begins. These two mornings were bright and a little cloudy leading to the milky colour of the sky. I always enjoy drawing and painting the reflections of the fishing platforms and trees on the lake. It is a fun challenge to capture the ever changing and moving colours in the water. Another element I added into this picture was the white bird which I saw flying low over the lake each morning. This was always very peaceful and majestic sight to see the beautiful creature and its reflection on the water. At first I thought it was a kind of stork but it turns out is a little Egret. As I was painting, my nephew was drawing next to me and I asked him to tell me whenever he saw the bird so I could see it and try to capture it in paint, this is more tricky than it sounds! But with his help I managed to see it enough times to paint it! This painting was done on 300gsm Watercolour Paper as I like to build up and overlay thin layers of paint and thicker higher quality paper is necessary for this.", "tags": ""},
